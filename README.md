"Dotted Dreamcatcher"

Dreamcatchers are said to be beneficial in having a beautiful dreams then pass through the threads and slide down the feathers to reach the sleeper and comfort him. 
Bad dreams, on the other hand, are trapped in the web and then destroyed, burned by the daylight. The interpretation of dreams has strongly influenced the cultural and spiritual beliefs of Native Americans for centuries.
They believed that dreams had an influence on the conscious soul of the dreamer. According to them, dreams could have an impact on character traits such as trust, maturity, kindness and loyalty.

This is my own version of mandala art inspired from a dreamcatcher but instead of using a lines or other shapes, I prefer to use a dots to fullfil
my chosen design.
I used a positioning functions and for loops in coding my mandala with the help of python turtle to I achieved my own design.
